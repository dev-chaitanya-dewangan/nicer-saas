    "Frequent deployment errors when pushing generated templates to Notion.",
    "AI-generated templates lack aesthetics or fail Notion API validation.",

  ],
  "requirements": [
    "Every template generated must be visually extraordinary, using advanced Notion design principles (headers, callouts, icons, colors, nested blocks, minimalism, clear layout).",
    "All generated templates must strictly conform to Notion API block and property specifications (no invalid types, limits respected, Unicode safe).",
    "Deployment flow must be robust: *no silent fails, all errors visible with actionable descriptions in UI and logs*.",
    "If Notion API returns an error, the system explains exactly what failed and why in plain language, not just generic 'deployment failed.'",
    "If template data is malformed or over Notion's limits (block count, nesting), prompt user to simplify or auto-refine it.",
    "System should allow easy preview (HTML/Mini-Notion render) in the UI before deploying to Notion.",
    "Always show which Notion account/workspace is targeted (user email, workspace name, avatar if available)."

    "On each generation, validate template JSON against latest Notion API schema before even attempting deployment.",

    "If deploy fails, prompt AI to auto-repair the problematic sections and retry (with user permission)."
